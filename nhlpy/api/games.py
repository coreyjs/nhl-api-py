            GameIDS are in the format {Season}{GameType}{GameNumber}.  For example, the first game of the 2020-2021
            season would be 2020020001.  This is also the gamePk field that can be found in the team schedule endpoints.

            For playoffs the {GameNumber} portion will be formatted as RRMG where RR is the round (01, 02, 03, 04),
            M is the matchup and G is the game out of 7.  So 2022030412 is the 2022-2023 NHL season, 03 means playoffs
            04 means fourth round, 1 means matchup (I really cant 100% figure this out)
             and 2 is the second game out of 7

            {Season} is the first 4 digits of the season year, so for 20222023 it would be 2022.

            {GameType} are the following: 01=preseason, 02=regular season, 03=playoffs, 04=all-star.

            {GameNumber} is the game number in the season, starting at 0001.
